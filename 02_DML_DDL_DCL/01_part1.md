##### Question

SQL consists of 3 different sub-languages. For example, one of these
sub-languages is called the Data Control Language (DCL) component of SQL. It is
used to control access to a database; it is responsible for defining the rights
and roles granted to individual users. Common SQL DCL statements include:

```sql
GRANT
REVOKE
```

Name and define the remaining 2 sub-languages, and give at least 2 examples of each.

##### Solution

SQL's other 2 sub-languages are Data Definition Language (DDL), and Data
Manipulation Language (DML).

Examples of DDL statements are:

```sql
CREATE
ALTER
DROP
```

Examples of DML statements are:

```sql
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
```
